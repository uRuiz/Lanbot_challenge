# Landbot Frontend Challenge

## Description

The challenge consists of two parts:

**Functional Javascript**

A frontend developer must have a minimum functional programming knowledge to work with graphs. Landbot bot builder is a tool that allows creating conversational flows through graphs.

The purpose of this challenge is implementing several functions, part of a complete library to handle graphs efficiently.

Tasks:

- Implement the functions defined in `./src/graph_utils/graph_utils.js`.
- Execute tests with `npm test` and check that all functions passed.

> Note: Read carefully the [docs](./DOCS.md)

**React JS**

As a web app can grow insanely with new features, we need to make sure our code is clean and scalable, and sometimes we need to refactor big components.

Tasks:

- Separate the `./src/components/Chat` component into several smaller components (create the folder structure you feel comfortable with).
- Check everything is working like before the refactor.

> (Optional) Use storybook with `npm run storybook` to organise your components.

### Documentation

> Document your code assuming that the next engineer looking at your code is a serial killer who knows where you live.

Use JSDoc 3 docummentation style. http://usejsdoc.org/
